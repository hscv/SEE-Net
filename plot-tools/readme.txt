Firstly, you MUST run the code in "test-AUC-DP-on-H_F-videos" or "test-AUC-DP-on-color-videos" to generate the ".mat" for further ploting the AUC and DP curve.
    The code in "test-AUC-DP-on-H_F-videos" is used to generate the results on hyperspectral videos or false-color videos.
    The code in "test-AUC-DP-on-color-videos" is used to generate the results on color videos.

Secondly, you can run the code in "plotAUC_DP_curve" to generate the AUC and DP curve.

Thirdly, you can run the code in "plotAttribute_Curve" to generate the AUC and DP curve in each challenging scene (i.e., attribute).

Finally, you can run the code in plotRect (Python code) to generate the results of qualitative comparison.
